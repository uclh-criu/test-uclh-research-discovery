The Health Data Cards website is a repository of research using patient data from UCLH. The information is aimed to the data science community, to learn how patient data is being used to help improve healthcare.

Each project provides information about the analysis performed and technologies
developed, the process followed to protect sensitive patient data, as well as
access to the software code behind, and synthetic datasets to enable others to
replicate their analyses.

Some projects might still be in progress, while others are finalised.

All analysts and research teams in our community are invited to publish their own projects, with as much details as they can, and giving access to any synthetic data or non-sensitive data that can be shared publicly and is required to understand their methodology.

## Founders

The platform was developed in collaboration between the teams at [UCL/UCLH BRC CRIU](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/clinical-research-informatics-unit), UCL's [Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre) centre, with support from the [CHIMERA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chimera/chimera-0).

### [CHIMERA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chimera/chimera-0)

The CHIMERA (Collaborative Healthcare Innovation Through Mathematics,
Engineering and AI) Centre examines anonymised data from 40,000 patients to
develop a better understanding using mathematical modelling of how people’s
physiology changes during ill health and recovery. This will in turn provide new
ideas for how critically ill patients can best be cared for.

CHIMERA’s partner hospitals, UCLH and Great Ormond Street Hospital, store data
collected every few seconds from monitors for patients in intensive care, such
as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and temperature. Only a brief
snapshot of this data is used to inform decisions around patient care at the
moment.

Researchers at CHIMERA will analyse this complex array of data using tools from
data science and machine learning, and then use this to develop new mathematical
models of how our body is behaving during ill health and recovery, to improve
care.

### [UCL/UCLH BRC CRIU](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/criu/)

The UCL/UCLH Biomedical Research Center (BRC) Clinical Research and Informatics
Unit (CRIU) consists of a team of clinicians, researchers, software developers,
business intelligence analysts and data scientists working together to develop a
robust environment and infrastructure for the analysis of clinical data.

The main goals are to:

- Facilitate clinical decision making supported by electronic health records (EHR).
- Optimise patient care and operational performance through data-driven innovation.
- Foster excellence in research at UCLH, one of the world’s leading teaching hospitals.

### [UCL ARC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/arc/)

The Advanced Research Computing Centre (ARC) is UCL's research, innovation and
service centre for the tools, practices and systems that enable computational
science and digital scholarship.

They are an innovative centre with both professional services and academic
missions:

- To provide advanced, reliable and secure digital research infrastructure to research groups in UCL and beyond.
- To be a laboratory for research, teaching and innovation in compute, data and software intensive research methods.
