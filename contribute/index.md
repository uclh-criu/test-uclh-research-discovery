## Contribute to {{site.title}}

We believe that all research using patient data should be visible to the public and the scientific community. We encourage all research teams to share the following

1. a lay summary of the research proposal
2. a synthetic example of the data
3. a simple vignette of their findings

### The lay summary

This can be submitted as soon as the project is approved.

### Synthetic data

Sharing data is important to meet the demands of scientific reproducibility, and the more open the share, the better we can hold ourselves to this standard. But even when working with anonymised data, there is a always a residual risk of re-identification. We manage this risk by providing support for generating synthetic data. We do this in two layers.

1. Data that is structurally identical but has never 'seen' the real data
2. Data that learns from the real data but only at the aggregate level 

We share layer 1 synthetic data publicly, and provide access to layer 2 data on request.

### Your findings

We recommend that teams share vignettes of key findings from their work here. This enables patients and the public to understand the impact health data science is having at UCLH.

## How to contribute

UCLH research teams can add their own projects to this site by making a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UCLH-Foundry/uclh-research-discovery). For detailed instructions, please see our [project submission process](./project_submission).
