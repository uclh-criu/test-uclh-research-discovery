A repository of research projects being carried at UCL and UCLH. The information is aimed at the data science community, to learn how patient data is being used to help improve healthcare, and provide exemplar synthetic data supporting the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.)

SAFEHR (Secure Anonymised Framework for Electronic Health Records) is a programme enabling health data science, AI and machine learning based at UCLH and jointly supported by [UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre) and the NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre's [Clinical Research Informatics Unit](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/clinical-research-informatics-unit).

<!-- Learn about the many different
research projects being carried out using patient data and how it is being
used to help improve patient care. Each project provides information
about the steps taken to protect sensitive patient data, as well as access
to code written by the researchers and synthetic datasets to enable you to
replicate their analyses. -->
