# Example (synthetic) Electronic Health Record data

These data are modelled using the OMOP Common Data Model v5.3.

## CSV files

The name of the file corresponds to the table in the OMOP CDM.

- [person](data/person.csv)
- [procedure_occurrence](data/procedure_occurrence.csv)
- [visit_occurrence](data/visit_occurrence.csv)

## Correlated Data Source

## Generation Rules

- The patient's age should be between 18 and 100 at the moment of the visit.
- Ethnicity data is using 2021 census data in England and Wales ([Census in England and Wales 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/bulletins/ethnicgroupenglandandwales/census2021))  .
- Gender is equally distributed between Male and Female (50% each).
- Every person in the record has a link in procedure_occurrence with the concept "Checking the position of nasogastric tube using X-ray"
- 2% of person records have a link in procedure_occurrence with the concept of "Plain chest X-ray"
- 60% of visit_occurrence has visit concept "Inpatient Visit", while 40% have "Emergency Room Visit"

## Notes
